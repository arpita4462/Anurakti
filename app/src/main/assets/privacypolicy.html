    Privacy Policy</h3>
<p style="font-size:15px;margin:10px;line-height:22px;padding:0px 0px 15px;text-align:justify"><b>We never sell your data. Period.</b> If we share your data, it's only with companies we've hired to do work for us to carry out the services you want. They'll never own it or be able to share it with anyone else. Your data is yours.</p>
<p style="font-size:15px;margin:10px;line-height:22px;padding:0px 0px 15px;text-align:justify"><b>Philosophy.</b> We're dedicated to consumer privacy rights and support privacy policies that are understandable. We're committed to responsibly handling any information we collect.</p>
<p style="font-size:15px;margin:10px;line-height:22px;padding:0px 0px 15px;text-align:justify"><b>Data use.</b> Many companies profit off their users by selling their info, but we'll never do that. We only use the data we collect about the way people use our products and our website to build better products. We'll never share any personal data about your online activity or use it to target you individually.</p>
<p style="font-size:15px;margin:10px;line-height:22px;padding:0px 0px 15px;text-align:justify"><b>Data sharing.</b> A few things that you do may require us to share data. For instance, when you buy one of our products with a your credit card, we have to share that info to process the payment. Some of our other services may also require some data sharing to provide the service. We try to do things ourselves but sometimes need to rely external companies. We make hard decisions about when to do so, always balancing the privacy risks against the benefits.</p>
<p style="font-size:15px;margin:10px;line-height:22px;padding:0px 0px 15px;text-align:justify"><b>Law enforcement.</b>We won't provide your information unless we're compelled by law with a valid court order, which is a much higher standard than the usual "permitted by law." Companies don't have to tell you when someone requests your data, but we will try and inform you so you can be aware and take legal action if you choose .</p>
<p style="font-size:15px;margin:10px;line-height:22px;padding:0px 0px 15px;text-align:justify">Except as required by law MyAnurakti <b>will not share your data with third parties;.</b></p>
<p style="font-size:15px;margin:10px;line-height:22px;padding:0px 0px 15px;text-align:justify">MyAnurakti will only retain user information for a maximum of <b>6 months after a user has canceled account </b>(except for basic information that the transaction occurred), and <b>6 months for website/App visitors, </b>except for any payment-related information that we have to retain for fraud purposes.</p>
